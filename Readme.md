## React Native Examples

This app has examples for react native apps. 

The intention is to show basic configurations and examples and reflect my experience of working with a number of the core community libraries and tools that are not included within a bare bones React Native init app.

Things generally work much less easilly straight out of the box with React Native, at least compared with ReactJS (and the various build tools it gets used with such as Create React App and Gatsby).

Though I've favoured other tools in the past, my favourites these days include Apollo Graphql (for backend communication), ui Kitten for slick ui interfaces on mobile and mobile web. Kitten works nicely on web, something I can't say confidently for many of the other React Native ui libraries that rely under the hood on react-native-vector-icons.

Because I like to test thoroughly, I make heavy use of React Native Testing Library, and I want to be sure that everything I do can run through it.
